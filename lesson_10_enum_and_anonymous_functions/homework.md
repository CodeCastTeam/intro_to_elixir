# Lessons 10 Homework - Enums and Anonymous Functions

## Implement the following using Enum (and possibly anonymous functions)

1. Given a list `[4, 6, 7, 4, 2, 0]`, write a code the returns a tuple of two lists: one that contains all even numbers and the the other contains all odd numbers.

2. Given two lists `[1, 2, 3]` and `[:a, :b, :c]`, write a piece of code that returns a list combining the two: `[{1, :a}, {2, :b}, {3, :c}]`.

3- Given a list of string `["hey", "abc", "yo"]`, write a piece of code that generates a capitalized sentence that is alphatically ordered. For instance, the code before should return `Abc Hey Yo`

4- Given a map `%{a: "hey", b: "abc", c: "yo"}` write a piece of code that capitalizes and prepends `AA` at the end of every element, so you should get back a map such as `%{a: "HeyAA", b: "AbcAA", c: "YoAA"}`.
 
5- Given a list of students (maps of students): `students = [%{name: "John", score: 10}, %{name: "Jen", score: 15}, %{name: "Alex", score: 13}]`. Write a piece of code that returns the student `map` of the student with the highest score.
