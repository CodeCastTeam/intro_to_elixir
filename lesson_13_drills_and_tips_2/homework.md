## More Fizz Buzz

Do the following variations of the Fizz Buzz questions:

1- Have the function return a list instead of printing, so the returned list will look something like: `[1, 2, "FIZZ", 4, "BUZZ", "FIZZ", 7, ...., 13, 14, "FIZZBUZZ", ...]`

2- Have the function return a map that looks like `%{0 => 1, 1 => 2, 2 => "FIZZ", 3 => 4, 5 => "BUZZ", ...}`

3- Have the function return a keyword list that looks like `["0": 1, "1": 2, "2": "FIZZ", "3": 4, "5": "BUZZ",....]`

Then answer the question: why did I have to use quotes around the keys for the keyword list and could do `[0: 1, 1: 2, 2: "FIZZ", 3: 4, 5: "BUZZ"...]`?
