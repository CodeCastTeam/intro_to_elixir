# Lesson 1 Homework

## 1. Install Elixir

For Mac & Linux Users, I recommend using ASDF:
https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf


For Windows, follow the instructions here: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#windows 


## 2. Make sure the Elixir plugin is installed on your favorite editor

For Visual Studio: Elixir LS

## 3. Setup an Exercism.org Account

We will be doing exercises on Exercism in the future.

If you don't have an account, create one here: https://exercism.org


## 4. Do the Hello World Exercise on Exercism

Start by repeating the hello world example here: https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir/exercises/hello-world 

Try to do it from memory first ;)
