# Lesson 2 Homework

## Immutability Experimentation

Attempt the following exercises in the different programming languages you know. If you only know one other programming language, then attempt to do these exercises differently using the same language.

Most importantly, notice where you mutate variables and where you don't.

a. Given a key/value data structure (such as Hash in Ruby or Object in Javascript), 
```
info = {name: "john", career: "programmer", city: "vancouver"}
```

Capitalize the keys. Notice if you mutated the original structure or not.


b. Give a string such as "wjekrhkwejrhkwejhrkwejhr". Capitalize every letter whose position is divisible by 3. Assume the first letter has a position 0.

Notice if you mutate the original string or not.

Bonus: if you mutated the original string, try to do it in another way where you don't.
