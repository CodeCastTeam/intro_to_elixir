# Lesson 7 Homework - Pattern Matching & Recursion
Using Pattern matching (and recursion), do the following:

- Find the number of elements in a list
- Convert a list to a string composed of all the elemenets. For example, if the list is `[3, 5, "hey", 10]`, you should return a string `"35hey10"`
- Stretch: Find the largest element in a list. Note: may include features we haven't learned together yet.
