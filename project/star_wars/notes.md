# Lesson 20: Project Set Up

We will be integrating with the Star War API: https://swapi.dev/ to learn how to handle API integrations with Elixir.

You can start a new project by running `mix new star_wars`

You can load up `iex` with all your module and all the libraries added using this command: `iex -S mix`
